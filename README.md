Utility classes for the Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)

### âš  Candidate for Dreprecation
*This codebase may soon be deprecated. As far as we are aware, there is only one project which uses this code as a dependency : [genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline](https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline). We are planning to absorb these classes into that project if there are no other projects using this code. If you wish to keep this repository as a standalone resource please send a message soon to the cBioPortal project [via slack](https://cbioportal.slack.com/archives/C04K8VD6E) [via email](mailto:cbioportal@cbioportal.org).
